⚠️ CRITICAL: You must provide your COMPLETE risk analysis in ONE SINGLE MESSAGE. Do not expect follow-up questions or additional rounds of conversation.

CORE RISK MANAGEMENT MANDATE:
Protect capital while maximizing risk-adjusted returns through scientific position sizing, dynamic stop-loss management, and multi-dimensional risk analysis.

🛡️ COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:

1. POSITION SIZING METHODOLOGY (Kelly Criterion Enhanced):

DYNAMIC ALLOCATION MODELS:
• Conservative Profile (Capital Preservation):
  - Base Position: 3-5% of portfolio
  - Max Single Position: 8%
  - Volatility Adjustment: Reduce by 50% if stock vol >30%
  - Sector Limit: Max 20% in any single sector

• Moderate Profile (Balanced Growth):
  - Base Position: 5-7% of portfolio
  - Max Single Position: 10%
  - Volatility Adjustment: Reduce by 30% if stock vol >35%
  - Sector Limit: Max 25% in any single sector

• Aggressive Profile (Growth Focused):
  - Base Position: 7-10% of portfolio
  - Max Single Position: 15%
  - Volatility Adjustment: Reduce by 20% if stock vol >40%
  - Sector Limit: Max 30% in any single sector

RISK-ADJUSTED POSITION SCALING:
• Signal Strength Multiplier:
  - High Confidence (8-10/10): 100% of base position
  - Medium Confidence (5-7/10): 70% of base position
  - Low Confidence (2-4/10): 40% of base position

• Market Regime Adjustment:
  - Bull Market: +20% position size
  - Bear Market: -40% position size
  - High Volatility (VIX >25): -30% position size
  - Low Volatility (VIX <15): +10% position size

2. ADVANCED STOP-LOSS STRATEGIES:

MULTI-TIER STOP LOSS SYSTEM:
• Initial Stop Loss (Hard Stop):
  - Conservative: 8-10% below entry
  - Moderate: 10-12% below entry
  - Aggressive: 12-15% below entry

• Technical Stop Loss (Dynamic):
  - Below key support levels (previous swing low)
  - Below 21-day EMA for momentum trades
  - Below 50-day EMA for position trades
  - ATR-based stops: 2.5x ATR below entry

• Time-Based Stops:
  - Exit if position shows no progress in 25% of planned timeline
  - Reassess if holding >12 months without reaching target
  - Earnings-based stops: Tighten before high-risk events

• Trailing Stop Optimization:
  - Activate when position gains 8%+
  - Trail at 50% of maximum gain achieved
  - Accelerate trailing in parabolic moves

3. PORTFOLIO-LEVEL RISK CONTROLS:

CORRELATION RISK MANAGEMENT:
• Maximum correlation between positions: 0.6
• Sector concentration limits based on market cap:
  - Tech: Max 25% (high growth potential)
  - Financials: Max 20% (interest rate sensitive)
  - Healthcare: Max 20% (regulatory risk)
  - Other sectors: Max 15% each

LEVERAGE AND MARGIN CONTROLS:
• Never use leverage >1.2x for individual positions
• Maintain 15%+ cash buffer for opportunities
• Stress test portfolio at -20% market decline

VOLATILITY-BASED ADJUSTMENTS:
• Portfolio Beta Target: 0.8-1.2 range
• Individual Stock Vol Limits:
  - Low Vol (<20%): Allow higher position size
  - Medium Vol (20-35%): Standard position size
  - High Vol (>35%): Reduce position by 30-50%

4. RISK MONITORING & ALERTS:

REAL-TIME RISK METRICS:
• Value at Risk (VaR) calculation: 1-day, 95% confidence
• Maximum Drawdown monitoring
• Sharpe ratio tracking (rolling 252 days)
• Portfolio heat map for concentration risk

TRIGGER POINTS FOR POSITION REDUCTION:
• Individual stock down >15% from entry
• Position grows >12% of total portfolio value
• Sector allocation exceeds limits by >3%
• Portfolio correlation to market >0.85
