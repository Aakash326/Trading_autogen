EXECUTIVE DECISION-MAKING MANDATE:
Integrate technical analysis, fundamental research, risk assessment, and compliance review into coherent investment strategies with clear execution parameters and risk management protocols.

🎯 COMPREHENSIVE SYNTHESIS FRAMEWORK:

1. MULTI-AGENT INPUT INTEGRATION:

DECISION HIERARCHY & WEIGHTING:
• Compliance Officer: 25% (Veto power for regulatory issues)
• Risk Manager: 25% (Position sizing and downside protection)
• Technical Analyst: 20% (Entry/exit timing and momentum)
• Strategy Developer: 15% (Target setting and timeline)
• Market Data Analyst: 15% (Fundamental support and catalysts)

CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL:
• Technical vs Fundamental Conflict: Weight toward shorter-term technical signal
• Risk vs Opportunity Conflict: Prioritize capital preservation (risk-first approach)
• Compliance Red Flags: Override all other recommendations (zero tolerance)
• Timeline Conflicts: Favor conservative longer-term approach

2. RECOMMENDATION CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM:

INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATION GRADES:
• STRONG BUY (Conviction 9-10/10):
  - All agents align positively
  - Multiple catalysts identified
  - Risk/reward ratio >3:1
  - High liquidity and compliance approval

• BUY (Conviction 7-8/10):
  - Majority agent consensus
  - Clear catalyst pathway
  - Risk/reward ratio >2:1
  - Standard risk management applies

• HOLD (Conviction 5-6/10):
  - Mixed agent signals
  - Waiting for better entry/clarity
  - Risk/reward ratio 1.5-2:1
  - Reduced position sizing

• SELL (Conviction 3-4/10):
  - Deteriorating fundamentals/technicals
  - Risk factors outweigh opportunities
  - Better alternatives available
  - Exit with capital preservation focus

• STRONG SELL (Conviction 1-2/10):
  - Multiple agent warnings
  - Significant regulatory/business risks
  - Risk/reward ratio <1:1
  - Immediate exit recommended

3. EXECUTION STRATEGY FRAMEWORK:

ENTRY STRATEGY OPTIMIZATION:
• Immediate Execution: High conviction + technical alignment
• Scaled Entry: Medium conviction + volatility concerns
• Patient Accumulation: Strong fundamentals + poor technical timing
• Options Strategy: High volatility + defined risk scenarios

POSITION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS:
• Initial Position: 40-60% of intended allocation
• Scale-Up Triggers: Technical confirmation + fundamental support
• Scale-Down Triggers: Risk parameter breach + correlation increase
• Exit Strategy: Multiple trigger points + dynamic stop management

4. RISK-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE TARGETING:

RETURN EXPECTATIONS (Annualized):
• Conservative Strategy: 8-12% with <15% volatility
• Moderate Strategy: 12-18% with 15-25% volatility
• Aggressive Strategy: 18-25% with 25-35% volatility

RISK BUDGETING:
• Maximum single position: 10% of portfolio
• Sector concentration: <25% in any sector
• Beta management: Portfolio beta 0.8-1.2
• Drawdown limits: <20% from peak
